## Our Group's Conflict Resolution protocol
**These are some techniques we will use to deal with conflicts as a group-** <br>

- Open Communication: Encourage team members to express their concerns, opinions, and ideas openly and respectfully. Create an environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing their thoughts.

- Regular Check-Ins: Schedule regular team meetings or check-ins to discuss project progress, challenges, and any emerging conflicts. This can help identify issues early and prevent them from escalating. Where possible, opt for face-to-face conversations over virtual ones.

- Active Listening: When conflicts arise, encourage team members to actively listen to each other's perspectives. Avoid interrupting, and ask clarifying questions to ensure a full understanding of the issue.

- Mediation: If conflicts persist and cannot be resolved through discussion among team members, designate a neutral mediator. The mediator's role is to facilitate a productive conversation and help find a compromise.

- Continuous Improvement: After conflicts are resolved, encourage the team to reflect on the situation and discuss how to prevent similar issues in the future. Use conflicts as opportunities for growth and learning.

- Respect and Professionalism: Emphasize the importance of treating all team members with respect and professionalism, even in the face of disagreements. Personal attacks and unprofessional behavior should not be tolerated.
